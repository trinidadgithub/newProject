I used this link to trouble shoot my connection:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17846529/could-not-open-a-connection-to-your-authentication-agent

Basically followed these steps in the documentation:

MsysGit or Cygwin

If you're using Msysgit or Cygwin you can find a good tutorial at SSH-Agent in msysgit and cygwin and bash( http://anterence.blogspot.com/2012/01/ssh-agent-in-msysgit.html):

    Add a file called .bashrc to your home folder.

    Open the file and paste in:

    #!/bin/bash
    eval `ssh-agent -s`
    ssh-add

    This assumes that your key is in the conventional ~/.ssh/id_rsa location. If it isn't, include a full path after the ssh-add command.

    Add to or create file ~/.ssh/config with the contents

    ForwardAgent yes

    In the original tutorial the ForwardAgent param is Yes, but it's a typo. Use all lowercase or you'll get errors.

    Restart Msysgit. It will ask you to enter your passphrase once, and that's it (until you end the session, or your ssh-agent is killed.)
